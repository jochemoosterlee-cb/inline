                            <h2 id="message-from-the-ceo">The world in 2022, a turbulent year</h2>
                            <p><b>2022 was a year of growth and recovery from an operational and profitability perspective. We realised a substantial increase in our revenue and got back in control on a number of complex projects. Profitability was restored while handling severe supply disruptions and price increases.</b></p>
                            <p>2022 was one of the most turbulent years in our company's 154-year history. Due to COVID-19, there were many restrictions imposed on Van Oord in recent years: travel restrictions, quarantine requirements and, of course, concerns around the health of our people. Fortunately, we saw that most restrictions were lifted over the course of 2022. The worldwide vaccination campaign made an important contribution to this.</p>
                            <p>On 24 February, the world was shocked by Russia's military invasion of Ukraine. This is a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented magnitude, a war in Europe with so far more than 100,000 casualties. It is the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II. The direct and indirect effects on our company have been substantial. We ceased all our activities in Russia and the projects in our order book have been cancelled. Where necessary, we have been able to support our Ukrainian crew members with, among other things, providing accommodation outside Ukraine. We have also seen employees of both Ukrainian and Russian nationalities work together on projects and vessels.</p>
                            <p>As a result of the war in Ukraine, we were confronted with disruption in our supply chains worldwide, which led to high inflation and price hikes for certain products. Some supplies were not available and this led to project delays. Where we were contractually unable to pass on these increases to our clients, we entered into discussions with clients for compensation. This has cost the company tens of millions of euros in 2022. As a result of these worldwide price increases and rises in interest rates, the economy has cooled considerably and there is the threat of stagnation and, in some of our markets, even of recession. We also saw a lot of turbulence in the world of energy in 2022. As a result of Russia stopping gas supplies to Europe and overdue investments in energy infrastructure, gas and electricity prices exploded in Europe.</p>
                            <div class="columns">
                                <div class="column-flex">
                                    <p>Politicians in Europe overwhelmingly supported energy independence from Russia, which led to a flood of new plans regarding the realisation of renewable energy projects. This mainly concerned offshore wind projects. In Esbjerg, for example, there was a commitment made between Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium to have 60 gigawatts of offshore wind installations by 2030 and to work towards 150 gigawatts of capacity installed by 2050.</p>
                                    <p>Governments and companies also gave resolute pronouncements on the achievement of the Paris targets: CO<sub>2</sub> neutral by 2050. Van Oord has endorsed the Paris targets and also committed itself to being CO<sub>2</sub> neutral by 2050. However, despite all efforts in the field of renewable energy, we saw CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the world rise slightly in 2022 as a result of the starting up of coal-fired power stations. We are increasingly confronted with the energy trilemma: to find a balance between sustainability, security and affordability.</p>

                                        <p>2022 was one of the most turbulent years in our company's 154-year history.</p>

                            <h3>Market</h3>
                            <p>Our markets recovered in 2022 in line with our expectations, with the exception of the Dutch infrastructure market, about which we are less optimistic due the ongoing nitrogen crisis, combined with the impact of cost increases on clients' budgets. Many experts believe that the world is on the verge of a raw materials 'supercycle', which means a shortage of many raw materials. This not only concerns oil and gas, but also the materials needed to realise the energy transition, such as steel, copper and aluminium. This will lead to structurally high prices for these raw materials and is also expected to lead to a wave of new investments during this decade.</p>
                            <p>New LNG ports, offshore gas and offshore wind projects provide growth potential for our business. Offshore wind will become a very important source of energy in North-West Europe in the coming decades, and we expect this to grow exponentially. In 2022 we also saw a recovery in the investments in fossil fuels. This is expected to be a temporary upturn. Gas will remain relevant as a transition fuel in the coming years. The energy transition is moving forward and will see an early acceleration, especially by countries that depend on fossil fuel imports. Van Oord will remain active in the oil and gas market in the coming years and will further increase its share in the renewable sector.</p>
                            <p>Despite major investments in renewable energy, the wind energy industry is facing serious financial challenges. There is a combination of factors causing unhealthy market conditions for this industry. Market imbalance (supply and demand), supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions and COVID-19 are making market conditions unprofitable for many parties including Van Oord.</p>
                            <h3>Revenue, result and balance sheet</h3>
                            <p>At EUR 2.0 billion, our revenue in 2022 was significantly higher than in 2021 (EUR 1.5 billion). We saw revenue growth in all our business units and a strong increase in the level of our activities in the Offshore Wind business unit in particular. We were able to successfully complete nearly 200 projects for our clients.</p>
                            <p>Our net result recovered to EUR 60 million after the net loss of EUR 62 million in 2021. All our business units were profitable, with the exception of Offshore Wind. The loss for Offshore Wind was due to price increases in the supply chain which we could not pass on to our clients, and the aftermath of some loss-making projects taken on in 2020 and 2021. The Dredging and Offshore business units achieved good results. The Netherlands business unit closed the year with a small positive result, and we were able to settle claim positions on a number of projects in 2022. This was very important in the recovery of our profitability.</p>
                            <p>In 2022 we took on new work for a net amount of EUR 2.0 billion. The gross award volume amounted to EUR 2.6 billion, however a number of old projects was removed from our order book — this mainly concerned projects in Russia and Angola. We saw a high volume of awards in Dredging and Offshore, although the award volume in the Offshore Wind business unit lagged behind. Our order book remained stable at EUR 4.3 billion. Our operating cash flow was EUR 62 million in 2022 compared to EUR 50 million in 2021. The net debt position increased from EUR 62 million at the end of 2021 to EUR 178 million at the end of 2022 driven by investments. Our leverage ratio is 0.9. We are once more ending this year with a strong position on the balance sheet.</p>
                            <p>Given our ambition for profitable growth heading towards 2030 and the associated investment volume, we are not yet at the desired level. However, the return on capital employed improved to 4.7% in 2022 and is therefore on the way to recovery.</p>
                            <blockquote>We saw a high volume of awards in Dredging and Offshore.</blockquote>
                            <h3>Investments</h3>
                            <p>Our first LNG trailing suction hopper dredger Vox Ariane became operational in 2022. The official launch took place at the Wilhelminapier in Rotterdam, a place well known to us, and we are very satisfied with the Vox Ariane's operational performance. In 2023 its 2 sister ships, the Vox Apolonia and the Vox Alexia, will enter service and our new cable-laying vessel Calypso will also become operational end of summer 2023. This ship is equipped with 2 cable carousels, which makes it suitable for laying HVDC cables (high voltage direct current). These cables will play an important role in offshore wind farms, especially those located further from the coast.</p>
                            <p>In 2022 we began the construction of our new offshore installation vessel Boreas. This jack-up offshore installation vessel is being built in Yantai (China). The crane, which can lift more than 3,000 tons, is being built at Huisman in China. We are pleased to say that the COVID-19 travel restrictions to China have been lifted, which will make construction easier. In addition, we ordered 2 more state-of-the-art water injection dredgers. These 2 WIDs will once more be built by Kooiman in Zwijndrecht. The design is based on the previously commissioned WIDs Maas and Mersey.</p>
                            <p>Our goal is to be climate neutral by 2050. On all our new ships, we are investing in the latest engine technology which will (in time) be able to run on the fuels of the future (methanol, ammonia, biofuels and hydrogen). At the moment, it is not yet clear which fuels will eventually be available for the shipping industry. The entire investment programme has been allocated more than 800 million euros.</p>
                            <h3>Organisation</h3>
                            <p>Our organisation is growing rapidly as a result of the market recovery. At the end of 2022, Van Oord had 5,243 employees (in FTE). Over the past year, our net workforce has increased by over 500 FTEs. As a result of the good labour market in North-West Europe, we see that staff turnover is higher than during the previous decade. This led us to expand our recruitment drive and we were able to take on many new employees. In the autumn of 2022, we conducted another employee engagement survey and were satisfied with the results, which were significantly better than the year before. With the help of these employee engagement surveys, we can see the areas in which our personnel policy still needs improvement.</p>
                            <p>In 2022 our employees' main concern was the wages policy. Due to the high inflation in 2022, market-based remuneration will be an even higher priority. Given the importance of our HR strategy, we appointed a Chief People Officer in the Executive Committee in 2022, Meike Salvadó-de Reede.</p>
                            <p>In terms of content, a great deal of attention was devoted to the lessons learned programme, in which subjects like risk management, quality assurance and balance of power were greatly improved. An important part of our HR strategy is the work of being a high-performance organisation. Part of this is an extensive leadership programme, which we developed together with IMD and are currently implementing.</p>
                            <h3>Sustainability and safety</h3>
                            <p>Major steps were taken in 2022 regarding sustainability. Within the 4 business units, we paid a lot of attention to making this concrete in the tenders, projects and implementation. There is a lot of variation, from incorporating Building with Nature solutions in the design and implementation phase to sustainability requirements in the supply chain, up to and including the use of biofuels to reduce emissions. Sustainability is also finding its way into the investment programme, particularly of the fleet. In 2022 we committed ourselves to a 1.5-degree pathway in line with Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) Maritime Guidance to tackle the reduction of Emissions in our scope 1, 2 and 3.</p>
                            <p>The S.E.A. programme (Sustainable Earth Actions) is running company wide, with 4 focal points directed at: accelerating climate actions, enhancing the energy transition, empowering nature and communities, and our approach to the decarbonisation of our business activities, ultimately working towards net-zero emissions by 2050. This is an important assignment which will mean tackling various uncertainties. We are motivated to work on this with various parties.</p>
                            <p>Our safety statistics showed a positive improvement in 2022 compared to 2021 (TRIR 2022 0.51 versus TRIR 2021 0.59). The nature of our work entails major risks for our employees and there has been a continuous effort over the past 2 decades to take our safety culture to a higher level. We will keep working on the continuous improvement of this culture. Our experience has taught us that you should never be complacent with your performance when it comes to safety.</p>
                            <h3>Business units</h3>
                            <p><strong>Dredging<br></strong>In 2022 we saw the continuation of the clearly observable market recovery. Revenue increased from EUR 727 million in 2022 to EUR 892 million. The occupancy rate of the trailing suction hopper dredgers in particular was considerably better than in 2021. The gross award and variation order volume was significantly higher than in 2021, at EUR 1.4 billion. The net award volume amounted to EUR 896 million versus EUR 843 million in 2021. The results, including income from settlements, in Dredging were satisfactory.</p>
                            <p>The business unit won new projects in the field of climate adaptation in countries such as Romania and the Maldives. The access channel with associated nature islands in Szczecin (Poland) was successfully completed.</p>
                            <p><strong>Offshore Wind<br></strong>The revenue of our Offshore Wind business unit rose sharply in 2022 (EUR 599 million in 2022 versus EUR 347 million in 2021). On the Saint-Brieuc project, foundations were drilled into the bedrock at a total of 41 locations. We expect to complete the project in 2023. We neared completion of the Greater Changhua project, although we experienced a lot of restrictions because of COVID-19. Due to difficult market conditions and price increases in the supply chain (also as a result of the war in Ukraine), there are insufficient returns both for us and for the sector as a result of which the business unit incurred a loss in 2022. In view of the importance of offshore wind in the energy transition, this situation is untenable. In 2022 we experienced a cautious market recovery, but we need a better balance between reward and risk. The award volume in 2022 was significantly lower than in 2021 (EUR 339 million versus EUR 962 million in 2021). In December 2022, we received a provisional award for the Hollandse Kust West project, which has not yet been included in our order book. The utilisation of offshore wind vessels in 2022 was high.<strong><br></strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Offshore</strong><br>Revenue in the Offshore business unit was slightly higher in 2022 than in 2021 (EUR 208 million in 2022 versus EUR 191 million in 2021). The results were satisfactory. The utilisation rate of our fallpipe vessels was higher than in 2021. Subsea rock installation on offshore wind farms is now the fastest growing market for our fallpipe vessels.<br>The important Golfinho project in Mozambique was suspended throughout 2022. The award and variation orders were significantly higher in 2022 than in 2021 (EUR 498 million in 2022 versus EUR 367 million in 2021). Projects in Russia were taken out of the order book.</p>
                            <p><strong>The Netherlands</strong><br>The risks we have seen in large-scale complex works — such as in the DBFM market — have forced us to take a more selective approach. The legal proceedings regarding nitrogen emissions have also caused significant delays in the preparation and implementation of the necessary infrastructure. The tender volume in the Netherlands was low in 2022, and we do not expect this to change any time soon. The government will have to take a critical look at its policies and procedures if it wants construction projects to remain viable in the Netherlands.</p>
                            <p>Revenue of the Netherlands business unit in 2022 was considerably higher than in 2021 (EUR 322 million in 2022 versus EUR 252 million in 2021) and the business unit realised a positive result in 2022. Mid year an agreement was signed with client Rijkswaterstaat on the impact of the changes in the hydraulic preconditions of the Afsluitdijk project. At the end of the year, the availability certificate was obtained for this iconic project and an important part of the work has now been successfully completed. We are particularly proud of the speed with which the Afsluitdijk has been made high water safe on both the Wadden Sea side and the IJsselmeer side.</p>
                            <p>Due to the nitrogen problem in the Dutch construction market, hardly any major infrastructure projects are being tendered and awarded. It is still unclear whether the ViA15 project will go ahead. The government has agreed to a compensation scheme for contractors involved in large (DBFM) infrastructure projects for cost increases. We have expressed our satisfaction with this. The award volume, including variation orders, was EUR 255 million in 2022 versus EUR 163 million in 2021.</p>
                            <p><strong>Strategy and outlook</strong><br>Our actions this decade have been based on our strategy Building the Future Together. In this strategy, we continue to focus on a portfolio of synergetic activities as a marine contractor. The starting point of this strategy is profitable growth. We are confident that our business will continue to grow this decade, supported by significant developments in our markets. The energy transition and climate adaptation are the 2 biggest factors driving this growth. We have the intention to reposition our organisation and merge from 4 to 2 business units in 2023. We will create 2 sizeable business units, Offshore Energy to accelerate the energy transition and Dredging and Infra to boost coastal and marine infrastructure to drive climate adaptation solutions.</p>
                            <p>In the short term, the uncertainties in our markets remain high. World economic growth in 2023 will be significantly lower than previously predicted. The risk of further stagnation or even a global economic recession has seen a considerable increase due to high inflation and rising interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainties can also have a major impact on our performance.</p>
                            <p>Despite the above, we expect a revenue increase in 2023 and a further improvement in our margins. We are still carrying out a few large projects that were awarded in the years where the risk-reward balance was not healthy. We expect our order book to increase further this year, mainly due to the growth of the offshore wind markets. We will continue to invest in the renewal and sustainability of our fleet in 2023 and the years thereafter. With our people's commitment, resilience, knowledge and competences, combined with a modern and efficient fleet, we have every confidence in the market opportunities of the coming years.</p>

                            <p>2022 was also marked by a return to normal life after the pandemic. We especially want to give thanks to our colleagues on vessels and projects. They went through difficult and uncertain times during COVID-19 and are therefore owed special recognition for their work and involvement within the company. We also thank our many clients who made it possible for us to continue and complete project work during the COVID-19 period. As a company, we look forward to the future with confidence.</p>

                            <h4>General</h4>
                            <p>Van Oord N.V. (Chamber of Commerce number 24355843) has its registered office in Rotterdam, Schaardijk 211, 3063 NH, the Netherlands, and is the holding company owning the shares of the Van Oord group companies. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Netherlands (Dutch GAAP) and comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The financial statements have been prepared upon a going concern basis.</p>
                            <h4>Reporting period</h4>
                            <p>The financial statements cover the financial year ending on 31 December 2022.</p>
                            <h4>Reporting currency and functional currency</h4>
                            <p>The financial statements are presented in euro (EUR), which is the company's functional currency. All financial information is presented in EUR (rounded to the nearest thousand), unless otherwise stated. </p>
                            <h4>Basis of consolidation</h4>
                            <p>The consolidated financial statements include the financial information of Van Oord N.V. and its wholly-owned group companies using the full consolidation method. Participating interests and contracting consortiums are consolidated proportionally, provided that the company exercises at least the same influence on policy as each of the other participants. Joint and several liability for the commitments of contracting consortiums is taken into account if necessary. The abbreviated company profit and loss account is prepared in accordance with Section 402 of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.</p>
                            <h4>Acquisitions</h4>
                            <p>Acquisitions are recognised using the purchase accounting method, whereby the acquired party's identifiable assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on the policies of Van Oord. The difference between the acquisition price and the fair value of all of the acquired party's identifiable assets and liabilities is recognised by Van Oord as goodwill in the balance sheet.</p>

                            <p>Balance sheet items of foreign group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses in foreign currencies, to the extent that these are hedged by forward exchange transactions, are translated at the forward exchange rates. All other items are translated at average exchange rates or at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Other exchange gains or losses are taken to the profit and loss account directly. Translation differences arising on the translation of foreign participating interests are taken to reserves.</p>

                            <p>The Dutch Accounting Standards Board (DASB) has issued 2 revised Standards, RJ 221 Construction Contracts and RJ 270 The Income Statement, which are effective as from 1 January 2022. The Company has applied the transitional method in which the changes as a result of RJ 270 are processed prospectively and effectively from 1 January 2022.</p>

                            <h5>Estimates and assumptions</h5>The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates which affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and related assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in future periods if affected by the revision. </p>
                            The most critical accounting policies in presenting the financial position and which require estimates and assumptions are those applying to the valuation of:

                            <p>At each reporting date the company assesses whether there is objective evidence that an asset or group of assets is impaired. In case of such evidence, the value in use is calculated with the discounted future cash flows which are derived from cash flow projections included in, management approved, projections for a period of five years. These are extrapolated for the later years and discounted against the estimated discount rate. The cash flow projections contain various assumptions and estimates of future expectations. The value in use is sensitive for the used discount rate and expected future cash flows.</p>
                            <p>As regards to work in progress, Van Oord has substantial contracts in progress and in its order book which, by their nature, are potentially high risk due to their size, complexity, and (long) duration. These projects are accounted for using best estimates of: the degree to which project revenue is achievable (allowing for contract variations), project expenses, and the expected profit on any contractually related maintenance phase. Because of their size, complexity and (long) duration, projects may also have a relatively large impact on the company's result. Project revenue, project expenses and hence the result made on projects at the time of completion may differ substantially from current estimates, amongst others as a consequence of negotiations with customers. </p>
                            <h5>Financial instruments</h5>
                            Financial instruments include both primary financial instruments, such as receivables, payables and derivative financial instruments. All purchases and sales of financial assets made according to standard market conventions are recognised as at the transaction date, being the date on which the group enters into a binding agreement. For the accounting policies applicable to primary financial instruments, please refer to the relevant individual balance sheet items. For the valuation and recognition of derivatives, please refer to the section 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.
                            <h5>Intangible fixed assets</h5>
                            Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price for newly acquired participating interests and the value of the company's share in the fair value determined in accordance with the Van Oord N.V. accounting policies. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line base on its expected useful economic life.
                            <h5>Tangible fixed assets</h5>
                            Tangible fixed assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less straight-line depreciation and / or impairments of tangible fixed assets based on their expected useful economic lives as stated in the notes to the consolidated balance sheet. Investments made during the year are depreciated from the date of purchase in sofar these have become operational. Retired tangible fixed assets are carried at the carrying amount or their net realizable value, whichever is lower. A tangible fixed asset is derecognised upon sale or when no further economic benefits are expected from its continued use or sale. The gain or losses arising on the disposal is taken to the profit and loss account. Repair and maintenance costs are recognised by means of a maintenance provision.
                            <h5>Financial fixed assets</h5>
                            Participating interests over whose financial and operating policies significant influence is exercised, even when less than 20% is held, are stated at the proportional share of their net asset value determined in accordance with the accounting policies of Van Oord N.V. Participating interests over whose financial and operational policies no significant influence is exercised are carried at cost less any impairment. Dividend is designated as income and recognised under financial income and expenses. Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost.
                            <h5>Deferred tax assets</h5>
                            Deferred tax assets are recognised at nominal value to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available for set-off, for which the group assesses the availability of deferred tax liabilities set-off, the possibility of planning of fiscal results and the level of future taxable profits in combination with the time and/or period in which the deferred tax assets are realised.
                            <h5>Stock</h5>
                            Raw materials and consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Van Oord applies the first-in/first-out system.
                            <h5>Receivables</h5>
                            Receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost, net of provisions for doubtful debts where necessary.
                            <h5>Cash at bank and in hand</h5>
                            Cash at bank and in hand is stated at nominal value.
                            <h5>Provisions</h5>
                            <p class="no-padding-bottom">Provisions are stated at the nominal value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the liabilities or losses. Provisions are discounted if the effect of discounting is material. If some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is likely to be reimbursed by a third party at the time when the provision is settled, the reimbursement is separately recognised as an asset.
                                <br />A provision is recognised in the balance sheet if:
                            </p>
                            <ul class="no-padding-top">
                                <li>a present obligation (legal or constructive) has arisen as a result of a past event;</li>
                                <li>the amount can be estimated reliably; and</li>
                                <li>settlement of the liability is likely to result in an outflow of resources.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences between tax and financial reporting purposes, and are carried on the basis of the tax consequences of the realisation or settlement of assets and liabilities as planned at the balance sheet date. The tax rates and tax laws used, are those that are (substantively) enacted at that date. Deferred tax liabilities are non-discounted and recognised under the provision for tax liabilities.</p>
                            <h5>Long-term liabilities</h5>
                            liabilities are initially carried at fair value minus transaction costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost.
                            <h5>Work in progress</h5>
                            Work in progress relates to contracts with third parties and is stated at cost, plus attributed profit, minus the realisable value of work completed.
                            <p>Cost comprises of direct project costs (such as the costs of staff directly involved in the project, costs of materials, subcontractor fees and charges for equipment), expenses attributable to general project activities and the project, and other costs contractually allocable to the customer.</p>
                            <p>Profit is accounted for on the basis of the technical progress of the work once this profit can be estimated reliably. The realisable value of work completed comprises the total work in progress instalments charged, and work completed but not yet invoiced. A provision for expected losses is deducted from the balance of work in progress.</p>
                            <p>The net amount for each contract is recognised as a current asset or a current liability where the balance of the construction contract is positive or negative, respectively.</p>
                            <h5>Other liabilities</h5>
                            Other liabilities are initially carried at fair value minus transaction costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost.
                            <h5>Pensions</h5>
                            The new principle pension plan is carried out by pension fund PGB and is a collective defined contribution plan based on an average pay plan and a target pension age of 68. Based on this collective defined contribution plan Van Oord will allocate a fixed contribution annually. The aim is to maintain the value of the accrued pension entitlements. The accrued pension entitlements are not assured and the decision on the level of indexation percentage is based on the coverage ratio of the pension fund and is taken by the Board of the PGB pension fund.<br />The coverage ratio at year-end 2022 is 113.2% (116.8%). The guiding principle is that annual pension charges are equal to the pension contributions payable to the pension administrator. A liability is recognised in so far as the contribution payable to the pension administrator has not been paid at the balance sheet date.
                            <h5>Derivatives and hedge accounting</h5>
                            Van Oord N.V. uses financial instruments ('derivatives'), such as forward currency contracts to hedge against risks associated with fluctuations in currencies. Van Oord carries these instruments at cost and applies cost price hedge accounting. Hedge relationships have been documented and are pre-reviewed for expected effectiveness. Effectiveness is reviewed on a regular basis. If the critical elements of the derivative and the hedged item are not the same, a certain degree of ineffectiveness is assumed and a quantitative ineffectiveness measurement is required. If that measurement reveals that the cumulative negative change in fair value of the hedging instrument is higher in absolute terms than the opposite change in fair value of the hedged item, then ineffectiveness exists, which will be directly recognised in the profit and loss account as a loss.
                            <h4>Income and expenses</h4>
                            <h5>Revenue</h5>
                            <h6>General</h6>
                            Net revenue represents the value of the work carried out in the financial year plus the profit on work completed in the year and income from some trading activities.
                            <h6>Performance obligations</h6>
                            Revenue is recognised per separate performance obligation. The nature of significant performance obligations and the method of allocating revenue to reporting periods, including the method of determining the extent of completion is described below. These performance obligations are the most significant ones, however, performance obligations are identified on a contract basis and can therefore differ from the below mentioned significant ones.
                            <p class="no-padding-bottom">In general the following performance obligations are distinguished:</p>
                            <ul class="no-padding-top">
                                <li>Construction, for which revenue is recognised based on the percentage of completion method;</li>
                                <li>Maintenance, for which revenue is recognised based on the percentage of completion method.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="no-padding-bottom">For balance of plant contracts, generally the following performance obligations are distinguished:</p>
                            <ul class="no-padding-top">
                                <li>Procurement, for which revenue is recognised based on the transfer of titles;</li>
                                <li>Execution/installation, for which revenue is recognised based on the percentage of completion method. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h6>Percentage of completion method</h6>
                            If the outcome of a construction contract can be reliably estimated, project income and costs from the contract are recognised in the income statement as revenue respectively costs pro rata to the extent of the work performed at the balance sheet date. The percentage of completion is generally determined based on the contract costs incurred in proportion to the estimated total contract costs.
                            <p>If the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are probably recoverable. The contract costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.</p>
                            <h6>Transfer of titles</h6>
                            When procured goods are legally transferred to the customer, the related revenue is recognised.
                            <h6>Transaction price</h6>
                            Revenue is recognised for the amount to which group expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of promised goods or services. If there are multiple performance obligations in a contract, the total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in proportion to the value of the performance obligations.
                            <h6>Contract modification</h6>
                            <p class="no-padding-bottom">An amendment to a contract is accounted for as a separate agreement if there is:</p>
                            <ul class="no-padding-top">
                                <li>An addition of promised goods or services that are distinguishable; and</li>
                                <li>An increase in the originally agreed consideration by an amount that reflects the value of the additional goods or services promised, taking into account appropriate adjustments to that consideration in line with the circumstances of the particular contract.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="no-padding-bottom">Other amendments are accounted for based on the following:</p>
                            <ul class="no-padding-top">
                                <li>If the remaining goods or services are distinguishable from those transferred on or before the date of the amendment, the amendment is accounted for as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract.</li>
                                <li>If the remaining goods or services are indistinguishable and therefore part of a single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the time of the amendment, the amendment is accounted for as an amendment to the existing contract. The effect of the modification on the transaction price and on the measurement of the progress towards fulfilment of the performance obligation is recognised as an adjustment to the cumulative revenue at the time of the modification.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Costs</h5>
                            Costs are determined in accordance with the accounting policies set out above and are allocated to the financial year to which they relate.
                            <h5>Employee benefits</h5>
                            Employee benefits and social charges are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which the employee services are rendered.
                            <h5>Share in result of participating interests</h5>
                            The share in the result of participating interests consists of the share of the group in the results of these participating interests.
                            <h5>Income taxes</h5>
                            Income taxes are calculated on the basis of the result disclosed in the profit and loss account, taking into account current tax facilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Together with its Dutch group companies, the company constitutes a fiscal unity. Taxes within this fiscal unity are settled based on the reported financial results of the respective entities. Tax assets and liabilities are netted if the general conditions for netting are met.
                            <h4>Cash flow statement</h4>
                            <p>The cash flow statement is prepared on the indirect method. The liquidities included in the cash flow statement comprise of cash at bank and in hand. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated at an average exchange rate. Transactions where no cash is exchanged are not included in the cash flow.

                            <p>In 2019 an EU Private Placement of EUR 200 million was arranged consisting of 6 tranches with terms of 5 to 10 years. During 2022 EUR 50 million was repaid.</p>
                            <p>The Revolving Credit Facility has a principle amount of EUR 450 million. The maturity date was extended with another one year to July 2026 for EUR 405 million, with EUR 45 million maturing in 2024. At 31 December 2022 EUR 200 million was drawn under the RCF.</p>
                            <p>In 2020 Van Oord signed a Green Loan Framework with a small number of banks on the back of 3 dual fuel (Natural Gas and Marine Gas Oil) hopper dredgers currently under construction. Under this Green Loan Framework EUR 130 million of variable rate loans have been secured all maturing in 2025. The maturity date was extended with another 2 years to respectively May 2027 and July 2027. At year-end 2022 the loans were fully drawn.</p>
                            <p>In December 2021 Van Oord signed an EUR 100 million loan with a commercial bank based on ECB's TLTRO funding programme.</p>
                            <p>This loan has variable interest and a tenor of 3 years with an option to request for extension of the loan with a maximum of 2 years.</p>
                            <p>Further details of effective interest rates, remaining maturities and currencies in which the interest-bearing liabilities are denominated are provided in the note on financial instruments under 'interest rate risk'. </p>
                            <p>At year-end 2022, the company was within the limits of the loan terms as agreed under the credit facility agreements (i.e. leverage ratio ≤ 3.5 and interest coverage ratio ≥ 4.0).</p>
                            <p>The average rate of interest on long term loans in 2022 was 1.6% (1.7%). The repayment of long term liabilities after 5 years until final maturity amounts to EUR 55 million (EUR 53 million). No direct security is provided for any of the loans including Green Loan Framework tranches & TLTRO loan.</p>

                            <p>Accruals and deferred income mainly concern accruals for project costs. The increase in 2022 compared to 2021 is<br />mainly driven by accruals in relation to investments. </p>
                            <h3>Financial instruments</h3>
                            <h4>General</h4>
                            <p>Van Oord N.V. and its group companies use various financial instruments as part of their normal business activities. These are either accounted for under assets and liabilities or are not included in the balance sheet.</p>
                            <h4>Credit risk</h4>
                            <p>In principle, payment risks are covered by bank guarantees, insurance, etc., unless the creditworthiness of the debtor has been assured. These procedures and the geographical spread of the group companies' activities limit exposure to credit concentrations and market risks.</p>
                            <h4>Liquidity risk</h4>
                            <p>The principle underlying liquidity risk management is that sufficient cash resources must be maintained or credit facilities to be available to meet current and future financial commitments under both normal and exceptional circumstances. Liquidity forecasts, which include available credit facilities, form part of the regular management information. In view of the nature of the activities and corresponding strongly fluctuating cash flows, the available cash at bank and in hand is usually not tied up for more than one year.</p>
                            <h4>Fuel price risk</h4>
                            <p>The fuel price is largely hedged by entering into forward contracts and contractual arrangements with customers. </p>
                            <h4>Foreign exchange risk</h4>
                            <p>Many project contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Virtually all positions in foreign currencies are fully hedged by means of forward exchange contracts. Forward currency contracts concluded to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations are valued at cost, and cost price hedge accounting is applied. Differences in forward rates arising from renewed forward exchange contracts are included in the balance sheet under current liabilities or assets. Forward exchange contracts are concluded for future cash flows mainly in US dollars. For this purpose, an amount of EUR 16 million (EUR 5 million) is included under other receivables at 31 December 2022, which is released as soon as the hedged future cash flow occurs.</p>
                            <h4>Interest rate risk</h4>
                            <p>The EU Private Placement is of a fixed-interest nature. The Revolving Credit Facility is fully of a variable-interest nature. The Green Loan Framework and TLTRO loan also have a variable interest. The variable interest on these loans is based on 1, 3 or 6 months EURIBOR (with a floor of 0%) plus margins of 25 to 175 bps.<br />With regard to interest rate risk exposure, Van Oord periodically evaluates the mix of fixed and variable interest rate liabilities, balancing the benefit of lower interest costs versus the variability of cash flows. Van Oord uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate exposure. Part of our floating interest has been hedged to a fixed rate by means of financial instruments. As at year-end 66% of our total interest on non-revolving loans is fixed until maturity of the respective loans.</p>

                            <h4>On-balance financial instruments and fair value</h4>
                            <p>The fair value of financial instruments included in the balance sheet, such as financial fixed assets, cash at bank and in hand, receivables, and current and long-term liabilities, is virtually identical to their carrying value.</p>
                            <h4>Off-balance financial instruments and fair value</h4>
                            <p>As of 31 December 2022, the (nominal) amount of the forward exchange contracts at the forward rates was EUR 216 million (EUR 140 million). The (nominal) amount of the currencies to be received under these contracts at the exchange rates at 31 December 2022 was EUR 193 million (EUR 141 million).</p>
                            <h3>Commitments, contingent assets and liabilities</h3>
                            <h4>Warranty commitments</h4>
                            <p>The warranty commitments not included in the balance sheet amount to EUR 960 million (EUR 915 million) at year-end 2022. The vast majority of the commitments relate to performance bonds issued to clients, which is common practice in contracting.</p>
                            <h4>Obligations pursuant to claims, procedures and investigations</h4>
                            <p>Van Oord is involved in - or may in the future be involved in - claims, procedures and (criminal) investigations, including regulatory, fiscal and other governmental, with possible financial and/or other consequences in the context of its business operations.</p>
                            <p>Events of non-compliance may result in regulatory or fiscal (criminal) investigations, litigations and/or sanctions. Although extensive efforts are made to act in compliance with all relevant (local and international) legislation and regulations, notwithstanding all risk mitigating measures, a complete elimination of compliance risk cannot be guaranteed. Any violation of any relevant legislation, including anti-bribery and corruption legislation or anti-money laundering legislation could be material on our operational performance and cash flow in an individual accounting period.</p>
                            <h4>Rental and lease commitments</h4>
                            <p>Total commitments under long-term rental and lease contracts amount to EUR 21.3 million (EUR 20.0 million). An amount of EUR 9.6 million will be paid in 2023. Total operational lease commitments amount to EUR 14.9 million, of which EUR 5.7 million will be paid in 2023. Commitments with a term longer than 5 years amount to EUR 0.0 million.</p>
                            <h4>Capital commitments</h4>
                            <p>Commitments relating to investments in tangible fixed assets amount to EUR 263 million (EUR 492 million) at the balance sheet date. An amount of EUR 88 million will be paid in 2023. There are no commitments with a term longer than 5 years.</p>
                            <h4>Agency fees</h4>
                            <p>Van Oord has own management teams in place in many parts of the world, but also works with agents to win and/or execute contracts. This can lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. </p>
                            <p>Some countries require us to engage an agent, and an agent can also provide local support during the execution of a project. Agents usually receive a (fixed) percentage of the contract price for their work, sometimes in the form of a (partial) success fee. That is why we try to mitigate the risks associated with working with agents through our Agent Policy. Stringent procedures relating to new and existing agents are in place and we engage the services of external professionals to support us.</p>
                            <p>Although our stringent policy and procedures did not reveal any concrete indications of possible irregularities, the risk of non-compliance with the applicable laws and regulations can never be completely excluded. Please refer to chapter 4 Governance (Risk and Compliance) for a more detailed explanation of our approach to and management of compliance risks.</p>

The set off of these losses are amongst others dependent on any future taxable profits. Of the total amount, around EUR 73 million (EUR 38 million) can in principle be carried forward indefinitely. EUR 3 million (EUR 21 million) relates to jurisdictions in which losses can be carried forward 3 to 10 years (average of 6 years) and based thereon the expiration of these losses is estimated to be on average approximately 3 years.</p>
