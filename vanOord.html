                <h3>General</h3>
                <p>Van Oord N.V. (Chamber of Commerce number 24355843) has its registered office in Rotterdam, Schaardijk 211, 3063 NH, the Netherlands, and is the holding company owning the shares of the Van Oord group companies. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Netherlands (Dutch GAAP) and comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The financial statements have been prepared upon a going concern basis.</p>
                <h3>Reporting period</h3>
                <p>The financial statements cover the financial year ending on 31 December 2022.</p>
                <h3>Reporting currency and functional currency</h3>
                <p>The financial statements are presented in euro (EUR), which is the company's functional currency. All financial information is presented in EUR (rounded to the nearest thousand), unless otherwise stated. </p>
                <h3>Basis of consolidation</h3>
                <p>The consolidated financial statements include the financial information of Van Oord N.V. and its wholly-owned group companies using the full consolidation method. Participating interests and contracting consortiums are consolidated proportionally, provided that the company exercises at least the same influence on policy as each of the other participants. Joint and several liability for the commitments of contracting consortiums is taken into account if necessary. The abbreviated company profit and loss account is prepared in accordance with Section 402 of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.</p>
                <h3>Acquisitions</h3>
                <p>Acquisitions are recognised using the purchase accounting method, whereby the acquired party's identifiable assets and liabilities as at the date of acquisition are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on the policies of Van Oord. The difference between the acquisition price and the fair value of all of the acquired party's identifiable assets and liabilities is recognised by Van Oord as goodwill in the balance sheet.</p>

                <p>A list of participating interests and contracting consortiums included in the consolidation has been filed at the offices of the Chamber of Commerce in Woerden (the Netherlands) in accordance with section 379 and section 414 of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The list also indicates for which companies Van Oord N.V. has been filed declarations of joint and several liability with the Chamber of Commerce and includes contracting consortiums in the Netherlands (VOF's) for which the company is jointly and severally liable for the non-consolidated part of the liabilities. A limited number of companies on the list in which Van Oord does not hold a majority of the shares, are consolidated as by means of deeds, agreements and arrangements control is obtained.</p>
                <h3>Foreign currency translation</h3>
                <p>Balance sheet items of foreign group companies denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses in foreign currencies, to the extent that these are hedged by forward exchange transactions, are translated at the forward exchange rates. All other items are translated at average exchange rates or at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Other exchange gains or losses are taken to the profit and loss account directly. Translation differences arising on the translation of foreign participating interests are taken to reserves.</p>
                <h3 id="revised-accounting-standards">Revised accounting standards</h3>
                <p>The Dutch Accounting Standards Board (DASB) has issued 2 revised Standards, RJ 221 Construction Contracts and RJ 270 The Income Statement, which are effective as from 1 January 2022. The Company has applied the transitional method in which the changes as a result of RJ 270 are processed prospectively and effectively from 1 January 2022.</p>
                <h3>Accounting policies</h3>
                <p><strong>Estimates and assumptions<br /></strong>The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates which affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and related assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in future periods if affected by the revision. </p>
                <p>The most critical accounting policies in presenting the financial position and which require estimates and assumptions are those applying to the valuation of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tangible fixed assets</li>
                    <li>Receivables</li>
                    <li>Work in progress</li>
                    <li>Provisions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At each reporting date the company assesses whether there is objective evidence that an asset or group of assets is impaired. In case of such evidence, the value in use is calculated with the discounted future cash flows which are derived from cash flow projections included in, management approved, projections for a period of five years. These are extrapolated for the later years and discounted against the estimated discount rate. The cash flow projections contain various assumptions and estimates of future expectations. The value in use is sensitive for the used discount rate and expected future cash flows.</p>
                <p>As regards to work in progress, Van Oord has substantial contracts in progress and in its order book which, by their nature, are potentially high risk due to their size, complexity, and (long) duration. These projects are accounted for using best estimates of: the degree to which project revenue is achievable (allowing for contract variations), project expenses, and the expected profit on any contractually related maintenance phase. Because of their size, complexity and (long) duration, projects may also have a relatively large impact on the company's result. Project revenue, project expenses and hence the result made on projects at the time of completion may differ substantially from current estimates, amongst others as a consequence of negotiations with customers. </p>
                <p><strong>Financial instruments<br /></strong>Financial instruments include both primary financial instruments, such as receivables, payables and derivative financial instruments. All purchases and sales of financial assets made according to standard market conventions are recognised as at the transaction date, being the date on which the group enters into a binding agreement. For the accounting policies applicable to primary financial instruments, please refer to the relevant individual balance sheet items. For the valuation and recognition of derivatives, please refer to the section 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.</p>
                <p><strong>Intangible fixed assets<br /></strong>Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price for newly acquired participating interests and the value of the company's share in the fair value determined in accordance with the Van Oord N.V. accounting policies. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line base on its expected useful economic life.</p>
                <p><strong>Tangible fixed assets<br /></strong>Tangible fixed assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less straight-line depreciation and / or impairments of tangible fixed assets based on their expected useful economic lives as stated in the notes to the consolidated balance sheet. Investments made during the year are depreciated from the date of purchase in sofar these have become operational. Retired tangible fixed assets are carried at the carrying amount or their net realizable value, whichever is lower. A tangible fixed asset is derecognised upon sale or when no further economic benefits are expected from its continued use or sale. The gain or losses arising on the disposal is taken to the profit and loss account. Repair and maintenance costs are recognised by means of a maintenance provision.</p>
                <p><strong>Financial fixed assets<br /></strong>Participating interests over whose financial and operating policies significant influence is exercised, even when less than 20% is held, are stated at the proportional share of their net asset value determined in accordance with the accounting policies of Van Oord N.V. Participating interests over whose financial and operational policies no significant influence is exercised are carried at cost less any impairment. Dividend is designated as income and recognised under financial income and expenses. Long-term receivables are stated at amortised cost.</p>
                <p><strong>Deferred tax assets<br /></strong>Deferred tax assets are recognised at nominal value to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available for set-off, for which the group assesses the availability of deferred tax liabilities set-off, the possibility of planning of fiscal results and the level of future taxable profits in combination with the time and/or period in which the deferred tax assets are realised. </p>
                <p><strong>Stock<br /></strong>Raw materials and consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Van Oord applies the first-in/first-out system.</p>
                <p><strong>Receivables<br /></strong>Receivables are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost, net of provisions for doubtful debts where necessary.</p>
                <p><strong>Cash at bank and in hand<br /></strong>Cash at bank and in hand is stated at nominal value.</p>
                <p><strong>Provisions<br /></strong>Provisions are stated at the nominal value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the liabilities or losses. Provisions are discounted if the effect of discounting is material. If some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is likely to be reimbursed by a third party at the time when the provision is settled, the reimbursement is separately recognised as an asset.<br />A provision is recognised in the balance sheet if:</p>
                <ul class="no-padding-top">
                    <li>a present obligation (legal or constructive) has arisen as a result of a past event;</li>
                    <li>the amount can be estimated reliably; and</li>
                    <li>settlement of the liability is likely to result in an outflow of resources.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences between tax and financial reporting purposes, and are carried on the basis of the tax consequences of the realisation or settlement of assets and liabilities as planned at the balance sheet date. The tax rates and tax laws used, are those that are (substantively) enacted at that date. Deferred tax liabilities are non-discounted and recognised under the provision for tax liabilities.</p>
                <p><strong>Long-term liabilities<br /></strong>Long-term liabilities are initially carried at fair value minus transaction costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost.</p>
                <p><strong>Work in progress<br /></strong>Work in progress relates to contracts with third parties and is stated at cost, plus attributed profit, minus the realisable value of work completed.</p>
                <p>Cost comprises of direct project costs (such as the costs of staff directly involved in the project, costs of materials, subcontractor fees and charges for equipment), expenses attributable to general project activities and the project, and other costs contractually allocable to the customer.</p>
                <p>Profit is accounted for on the basis of the technical progress of the work once this profit can be estimated reliably. The realisable value of work completed comprises the total work in progress instalments charged, and work completed but not yet invoiced. A provision for expected losses is deducted from the balance of work in progress.</p>
                <p>The net amount for each contract is recognised as a current asset or a current liability where the balance of the construction contract is positive or negative, respectively.</p>
                <p><strong>Other liabilities<br /></strong>Other liabilities are initially carried at fair value minus transaction costs and subsequently stated at amortised cost.</p>
                <p><strong>Pensions<br /></strong>The new principle pension plan is carried out by pension fund PGB and is a collective defined contribution plan based on an average pay plan and a target pension age of 68. Based on this collective defined contribution plan Van Oord will allocate a fixed contribution annually. The aim is to maintain the value of the accrued pension entitlements. The accrued pension entitlements are not assured and the decision on the level of indexation percentage is based on the coverage ratio of the pension fund and is taken by the Board of the PGB pension fund.<br />The coverage ratio at year-end 2022 is 113.2% (116.8%). The guiding principle is that annual pension charges are equal to the pension contributions payable to the pension administrator. A liability is recognised in so far as the contribution payable to the pension administrator has not been paid at the balance sheet date.</p>
                <p><strong>Derivatives and hedge accounting<br /></strong>Van Oord N.V. uses financial instruments ('derivatives'), such as forward currency contracts to hedge against risks associated with fluctuations in currencies. Van Oord carries these instruments at cost and applies cost price hedge accounting. Hedge relationships have been documented and are pre-reviewed for expected effectiveness. Effectiveness is reviewed on a regular basis. If the critical elements of the derivative and the hedged item are not the same, a certain degree of ineffectiveness is assumed and a quantitative ineffectiveness measurement is required. If that measurement reveals that the cumulative negative change in fair value of the hedging instrument is higher in absolute terms than the opposite change in fair value of the hedged item, then ineffectiveness exists, which will be directly recognised in the profit and loss account as a loss.</p>
                <h3>Income and expenses</h3>
                <p><strong>Revenue<br /></strong></p>
                <p><strong>General<br /></strong>Net revenue represents the value of the work carried out in the financial year plus the profit on work completed in the year and income from some trading activities.</p>
                <p><strong>Performance obligations<br /></strong>Revenue is recognised per separate performance obligation. The nature of significant performance obligations and the method of allocating revenue to reporting periods, including the method of determining the extent of completion is described below. These performance obligations are the most significant ones, however, performance obligations are identified on a contract basis and can therefore differ from the below mentioned significant ones.</p>
                <p>In general the following performance obligations are distinguished:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Construction, for which revenue is recognised based on the percentage of completion method;</li>
                    <li>Maintenance, for which revenue is recognised based on the percentage of completion method.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For balance of plant contracts, generally the following performance obligations are distinguished:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Procurement, for which revenue is recognised based on the transfer of titles;</li>
                    <li>Execution/installation, for which revenue is recognised based on the percentage of completion method. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Percentage of completion method<br /></strong>If the outcome of a construction contract can be reliably estimated, project income and costs from the contract are recognised in the income statement as revenue respectively costs pro rata to the extent of the work performed at the balance sheet date. The percentage of completion is generally determined based on the contract costs incurred in proportion to the estimated total contract costs.</p>
                <p>If the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are probably recoverable. The contract costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.</p>
                <p><strong>Transfer of titles<br /></strong>When procured goods are legally transferred to the customer, the related revenue is recognised.<strong><br /><br /></strong><strong>Transaction price<br /></strong>Revenue is recognised for the amount to which group expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of promised goods or services. If there are multiple performance obligations in a contract, the total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in proportion to the value of the performance obligations. </p>
                <p><strong>Contract modification<br /></strong>An amendment to a contract is accounted for as a separate agreement if there is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An addition of promised goods or services that are distinguishable; and</li>
                    <li>An increase in the originally agreed consideration by an amount that reflects the value of the additional goods or services promised, taking into account appropriate adjustments to that consideration in line with the circumstances of the particular contract.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other amendments are accounted for based on the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the remaining goods or services are distinguishable from those transferred on or before the date of the amendment, the amendment is accounted for as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract.</li>
                    <li>If the remaining goods or services are indistinguishable and therefore part of a single performance obligation that is partially satisfied at the time of the amendment, the amendment is accounted for as an amendment to the existing contract. The effect of the modification on the transaction price and on the measurement of the progress towards fulfilment of the performance obligation is recognised as an adjustment to the cumulative revenue at the time of the modification.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Costs<br /></strong>Costs are determined in accordance with the accounting policies set out above and are allocated to the financial year to which they relate.<strong><br /></strong></p>
                <p><strong>Employee benefits<br /></strong>Employee benefits and social charges are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which the employee services are rendered.</p>
                <p><strong>Share in result of participating interests<br /></strong>The share in the result of participating interests consists of the share of the group in the results of these participating interests.</p>
                <p><strong>Income taxes<br /></strong>Income taxes are calculated on the basis of the result disclosed in the profit and loss account, taking into account current tax facilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Together with its Dutch group companies, the company constitutes a fiscal unity. Taxes within this fiscal unity are settled based on the reported financial results of the respective entities. Tax assets and liabilities are netted if the general conditions for netting are met.</p>
                <h3>Cash flow statement</h3>
                <p>The cash flow statement is prepared on the indirect method. The liquidities included in the cash flow statement comprise of cash at bank and in hand. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated at an average exchange rate. Transactions where no cash is exchanged are not included in the cash flow.</p>

                <p>The disposal includes our share in Two Towers B.V.. This sale resulted in EUR 34 million of cash proceeds and EUR 7.2 million of book result in 2022. All loans provided to Two Towers B.V. amounting to EUR 18.4 million have been repaid.</p>
                <p>Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. The deferred assets at year-end 2022 include positions of in total EUR 10.8 million which are expected to be settled within one year (2021: EUR 7.5 million).</p>
                <p>The impairment of loans in 2021 and 2022 reflects the write-down to the lower net realisable value which is anticipated to be recovered. In the profit and loss account this amount is included in Costs.</p>

                <p>This loan has variable interest and a tenor of 3 years with an option to request for extension of the loan with a maximum of 2 years.</p>
                <p>Further details of effective interest rates, remaining maturities and currencies in which the interest-bearing liabilities are denominated are provided in the note on financial instruments under 'interest rate risk'. </p>
                <p>At year-end 2022, the company was within the limits of the loan terms as agreed under the credit facility agreements (i.e. leverage ratio ≤ 3.5 and interest coverage ratio ≥ 4.0).</p>
                <p>The average rate of interest on long term loans in 2022 was 1.6% (1.7%). The repayment of long term liabilities after 5 years until final maturity amounts to EUR 55 million (EUR 53 million). No direct security is provided for any of the loans including Green Loan Framework tranches &amp; TLTRO loan.</p>

                <p>Accruals and deferred income mainly concern accruals for project costs. The increase in 2022 compared to 2021 is<br />mainly driven by accruals in relation to investments. </p>

                <h3>Financial instruments</h3>
                <p><strong>General</strong></p>
                <p>Van Oord N.V. and its group companies use various financial instruments as part of their normal business activities. These are either accounted for under assets and liabilities or are not included in the balance sheet.</p>
                <p><strong>Credit risk</strong></p>
                <p>In principle, payment risks are covered by bank guarantees, insurance, etc., unless the creditworthiness of the debtor has been assured. These procedures and the geographical spread of the group companies' activities limit exposure to credit concentrations and market risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Liquidity risk</strong></p>
                <p>The principle underlying liquidity risk management is that sufficient cash resources must be maintained or credit facilities to be available to meet current and future financial commitments under both normal and exceptional circumstances. Liquidity forecasts, which include available credit facilities, form part of the regular management information. In view of the nature of the activities and corresponding strongly fluctuating cash flows, the available cash at bank and in hand is usually not tied up for more than one year.</p>
                <p><strong>Fuel price risk</strong></p>
                <p>The fuel price is largely hedged by entering into forward contracts and contractual arrangements with customers. </p>
                <p><strong>Foreign exchange risk</strong></p>
                <p>Many project contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. Virtually all positions in foreign currencies are fully hedged by means of forward exchange contracts. Forward currency contracts concluded to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations are valued at cost, and cost price hedge accounting is applied. Differences in forward rates arising from renewed forward exchange contracts are included in the balance sheet under current liabilities or assets. Forward exchange contracts are concluded for future cash flows mainly in US dollars. For this purpose, an amount of EUR 16 million (EUR 5 million) is included under other receivables at 31 December 2022, which is released as soon as the hedged future cash flow occurs.</p>
                <p><strong>Interest rate risk</strong></p>
                <p>The EU Private Placement is of a fixed-interest nature. The Revolving Credit Facility is fully of a variable-interest nature. The Green Loan Framework and TLTRO loan also have a variable interest. The variable interest on these loans is based on 1, 3 or 6 months EURIBOR (with a floor of 0%) plus margins of 25 to 175 bps.<br />With regard to interest rate risk exposure, Van Oord periodically evaluates the mix of fixed and variable interest rate liabilities, balancing the benefit of lower interest costs versus the variability of cash flows. Van Oord uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate exposure. Part of our floating interest has been hedged to a fixed rate by means of financial instruments. As at year-end 66% of our total interest on non-revolving loans is fixed until maturity of the respective loans.</p>

                <h3>Commitments, contingent assets and liabilities</h3>
                <p><strong>Warranty commitments</strong></p>
                <p>The warranty commitments not included in the balance sheet amount to EUR 960 million (EUR 915 million) at year-end 2022. The vast majority of the commitments relate to performance bonds issued to clients, which is common practice in contracting.</p>
                <p><strong>Obligations pursuant to claims, procedures and investigations</strong></p>
                <p>Van Oord is involved in - or may in the future be involved in - claims, procedures and (criminal) investigations, including regulatory, fiscal and other governmental, with possible financial and/or other consequences in the context of its business operations.</p>
                <p>Events of non-compliance may result in regulatory or fiscal (criminal) investigations, litigations and/or sanctions. Although extensive efforts are made to act in compliance with all relevant (local and international) legislation and regulations, notwithstanding all risk mitigating measures, a complete elimination of compliance risk cannot be guaranteed. Any violation of any relevant legislation, including anti-bribery and corruption legislation or anti-money laundering legislation could be material on our operational performance and cash flow in an individual accounting period.</p>
                <p><strong>Rental and lease commitments</strong></p>
                <p>Total commitments under long-term rental and lease contracts amount to EUR 21.3 million (EUR 20.0 million). An amount of EUR 9.6 million will be paid in 2023. Total operational lease commitments amount to EUR 14.9 million, of which EUR 5.7 million will be paid in 2023. Commitments with a term longer than 5 years amount to EUR 0.0 million.</p>
                <p><strong>Capital commitments</strong></p>
                <p>Commitments relating to investments in tangible fixed assets amount to EUR 263 million (EUR 492 million) at the balance sheet date. An amount of EUR 88 million will be paid in 2023. There are no commitments with a term longer than 5 years.</p>
                <p><strong>Agency fees</strong></p>
                <p>Van Oord has own management teams in place in many parts of the world, but also works with agents to win and/or execute contracts. This can lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. </p>
                <p>Some countries require us to engage an agent, and an agent can also provide local support during the execution of a project. Agents usually receive a (fixed) percentage of the contract price for their work, sometimes in the form of a (partial) success fee. That is why we try to mitigate the risks associated with working with agents through our Agent Policy. Stringent procedures relating to new and existing agents are in place and we engage the services of external professionals to support us.</p>
                <p>Although our stringent policy and procedures did not reveal any concrete indications of possible irregularities, the risk of non-compliance with the applicable laws and regulations can never be completely excluded. Please refer to chapter 4 Governance (Risk and Compliance) for a more detailed explanation of our approach to and management of compliance risks.</p>
                <p><strong>Related parties</strong></p>
                <p>Van Oord classifies group companies, the Executive Committee, the Supervisory Board and (participations of) the shareholders as related parties. Related-party transactions are carried out at arm's length basis. </p>

                <p>Future loss relief corresponds to a tax amount of approximately EUR 76 million (EUR 59 million) which is not recognised as a deferred tax asset in the balance sheet of Van Oord. The set off of these losses are amongst others dependent on any future taxable profits. Of the total amount, around EUR 73 million (EUR 38 million) can in principle be carried forward indefinitely. EUR 3 million (EUR 21 million) relates to jurisdictions in which losses can be carried forward 3 to 10 years (average of 6 years) and based thereon the expiration of these losses is estimated to be on average approximately 3 years.</p>
